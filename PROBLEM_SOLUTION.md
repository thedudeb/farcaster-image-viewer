# The Problem: Fragmented Art Viewing on Farcaster

## Current State: Scattered Artwork

When you discover an artist on Farcaster, you don't really see all of their art, or an album of their art they choose to show you.

- **Individual posts**: You see one piece of art at a time, posted randomly in your feed
- **No context**: Hard to understand the artist's style, progression, or body of work
- **Lost connections**: Great artists you discover get buried in the constant stream of content
- **Incomplete picture**: You might love one piece but never see the full scope of their talent
- **Temporal chaos**: Artwork appears out of chronological order, making it impossible to follow an artist's journey

## The Solution: A Unified Art Gallery Experience

This mini app transforms how you discover and appreciate artists by providing:

### üé® **Complete Body of Work**
- View an artist's entire curated collection (or what they chose to show) in one place
- See the progression and evolution of their style over time
- Understand the full scope of their creative vision

### üèõÔ∏è **Gallery-Style Presentation**
- Experience art the way it's meant to be viewed - as a cohesive collection
- Navigate through epochs (curated time periods) that showcase artistic growth
- Appreciate the relationships between different pieces and series

### üîç **Better Discovery**
- Find artists whose work resonates with you through complete collections
- Make informed decisions about which artists to follow
- Discover hidden gems that might have been missed in the feed

### üì± **Optimized Viewing**
- Pinch to zoom for detailed examination
- Smooth navigation between pieces
- High-quality image formats (WebP) for fast loading
- Mobile-first design that works perfectly on any device

## Why This Matters

Art isn't meant to be consumed in isolation. Great artists develop their voice over time, and their work tells a story that's impossible to appreciate through scattered posts. This mini app bridges the gap between social media's fragmented nature and the immersive experience of visiting a real art gallery.

By providing a unified view of an artist's work, we're not just solving a technical problem - we're creating a better way to discover, appreciate, and connect with the incredible artists in the Farcaster ecosystem.

**Experience the difference: See the full picture, not just the fragments.**
